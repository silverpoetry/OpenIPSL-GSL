<p>This package brings information on how to use the simulation results from Example 1 in order to perform the control design of a Power System Stabilizer (PSS) for the system in Example 1.</p>
<p>Note that this package shows, step-by-step, how the generator can be connected to the PSS and it also presents a Modelica function that can be used to tune the controller gain using Root Locus technique.</p>
