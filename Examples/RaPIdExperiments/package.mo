<p>This package contains examples used in different experiments of model agreggation and parameter identification using the Rapid Parameter Identification (RaPId) toolbox.
Therefore, the user will find simulation systems, but also models that can be linearized.</p>
<p>The package uses mainly PSSE models for representing machines and exciters. The user will also find that some of the components have their disturbance sources connected to their input.</p>
